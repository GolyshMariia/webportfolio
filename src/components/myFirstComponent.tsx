      <p>Inclusive writing
Now that you’re aware of the presentation of text, it’s time to focus on the way you write it. 

Language is always evolving, which means inclusive writing will continuously change along with it. But much of what impacts how inclusive (or exclusionary) your writing is depends on three main factors: language, references, and formatting. 

Inclusive language
There’s so much more to inclusive language than getting pronouns right. Though that’s incredibly important, too, truly inclusive writing fosters a sense of belonging and greatly reduces the chances you’ll cause harm to someone interacting with your content. How you phrase things, the references you include, and even the colloquialisms you use have more influence than you might think. 

As you produce content, keep these guidelines in mind:

Avoid gendered language
Words and phrases like “ladies and gentlemen,” “mankind,” and “businesswoman” are unnecessarily gendered and exclusionary. Swap these words with neutral alternatives like “folks,” “human beings,” and “business person.” 

Don’t use terms that rely on negative connotations
It’s easy to stumble into phrases that seem innocuous but actually originate from harmful historical events and beliefs. For example, “blacklist/whitelist” relies on discriminatory metaphors about race, “blindspot” refers to vision-related disabilities, and the term “womxn” was originally coined to purposefully exclude trans women.

Think twice before using idioms and ability-specific calls to action
Similarly to the above, many idioms are hurtful and exclusionary. For instance, “that’s crazy” references mental and psychiatric disabilities. Common call to actions (CTAs) like “see this” or “listen in” exclude people with associated disabilities. 

Usually, the easiest way to be more inclusive is to be specific. Say “block/permit” instead of “blacklist/whitelist.” Describe a situation as “unheard of” instead of “crazy.” Invite people to “explore” your services instead of “see” them.

Check out our own inclusive writing guidelines for an always-evolving list of more terms to avoid, why, and their alternatives.

Diverse references
No one likes to be on the outside of an inside joke, and the same goes for references that leave people guessing or feeling excluded. 

Think beyond western norms. When you rely heavily on references from a single culture, it can not only exclude people, but also cause confusion. Take “Turkey Race,” for example. If you grew up in the US, those words likely conjure pictures of 5ks that happen around Thanksgiving. But what if I told you that in Puerto Rico, a Turkey Race (carrera del pavo) is the tradition of people running a race to win a literal (frozen) turkey? Same words, two different events. And Thanksgiving and related turkey traditions won’t really resonate with people outside of North America. 

Be sure to diversify your examples, too. Only using names like “John Smith” and “Jane Doe” in your examples is the writing equivalent of those souvenir name keychains that never have diverse names. Why not Sade, Asim, Fatima, or Tâm? If you’re not sure which gender those names apply to, even better — examples should not rely on gender either.

Accessible writing and formatting
Inclusive writing also means formatting your content in a way that makes it accessible to as many people as possible.
